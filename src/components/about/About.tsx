                in the '90s with the purchase of an IBM PC for our home. This early exposure to 
                technology ignited a lifelong curiosity that has only grown over the years. 
                Pursuing this interest, I studied Technical Engineering in Computer Management at 
                the University of Alicante, laying a solid foundation for my career in technology.

                startup ecosystem in 2019. I've thrived on the challenge of growing various projects 
                from their inception to rapid maturity.`}
